This is a [juxt/modular](https://github.com/juxt/modular) and [juxt/cylon](https://github.com/juxt/cylon) (Oauth2) example integration

You can read more [http://tangrammer.github.io](http://tangrammer.github.io/posts/13-01-2015-using-cylon-oauth2.html)

## Usage

To run the application, install [Leiningen](http://leiningen.org/) and type

```
lein run
```

## Deploy GAE

```clojure
lein clean
lein ring uberwar
unzip target/cylon-oauth2-demo-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.war -d target/war
cp appengine-web.xml target/war/WEB-INF/
appcfg.sh --oauth2 update target/war/

```

```clojure

(def refresh-token "1/DGLSKAIlChe1jPJB1dCGpE2BhX-a_EOr850Vhx3jnxg")
(apply client/refresh-access-token ((juxt :authorize-uri :client-id :client-secret ) (-> system :webapp-oauth-client) ))

```

## Development

For rapid development, use the REPL from the command line or via your
favorite code editor.

```
lein repl
user> (dev)
dev> (go)
```

**Visit your app**   
[http://localhost:8010](http://localhost:8010)

After making code changes, reset your application's state (causing all
your modifications to be reloaded too).

```
dev> (reset)
```

To add a test user `[:uid "tangrammer" :password "clojure"]` each time you reset your app

```
dev> (reset+data)
```

Rinse and repeat.
